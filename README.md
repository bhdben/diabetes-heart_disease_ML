Inspired by Siddhardham on Youtube: This project was created to refine my ML skills as well as get some experience developing web apps. Inspired by  Here are the main points of the project:

1) Import and explore the Kaggle datasets

2) Select and Train models. A logistic regression model was used for Heart Disease, and a Support Vector Machine was used for Diabetes. Both of these were from the sklearn library.

3) Build a front end. This was done using the Streamlit library, an important consideration was that users had to be able to input data. 

4) Host Via Heroku

Key takeaways:
1) This gave me experience using different ML models. What I learned can be applied to any number of different datasets.
2) I gained experience creating web apps and front ends that users/clients could interact with
3) I learned a lot about using GitHub as well as VENVs. This project truly dropped me in the deep end and I had to learn to swim.
